# StaticKayakingTimerDisplay

[![Uses HTML/CSS/JS](https://img.shields.io/badge/Uses-HTML&sol;CSS&sol;JS-brightgreen.svg?style=for-the-badge)](//shields.io/)

A web based timer display developed for the 2016 Static Kayaking challenge.

The aim was to project some form of display on a screen so that the participants and audience of the challenge could keep track of their efforts on how much money has been raised.

Actual deployment was on the [club server](https://infocommsociety.com/~yicheng/24hrkayak/).
